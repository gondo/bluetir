**BLUETIR**

The purpose of this gem is to create a black box deployment test suite for Magento.
This is far from complete and to be honest, we'll probably refactor it.

## What is this?

### BlueTir is a very interesting idea. Based on <http://watir.com/> this framework has really help us test multiple areas of Magento pre and post deployment.

## I promise more documentation will come soon. 

I really wanted to share this ASAP but remember that it was built in a couple of hours of intense development so there may be a bunch of bugs.

## Known Bugs

There aren't many but I can assure you there are a bunch - Don't use this in a critical deployment yet
